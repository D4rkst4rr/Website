          <h3 class="text-center">PURCHASING MANAGEMENT</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">Purchasing management refers to the process of acquiring goods or services from external sources to support an organization's operations. 
            The primary goal of purchasing management is to acquire goods and services of the required quality at the right time and at the lowest possible cost. Effective purchasing management involves several key activities, including:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Identifying Purchasing Needs: The first step in effective purchasing management is to identify the goods or services that the organization needs to acquire. This involves understanding the organization's requirements, such as quality, quantity, and delivery time.</li>
              <li>Supplier Selection: Once the organization has identified its purchasing needs, it needs to identify potential suppliers who can meet those needs. This involves evaluating suppliers based on factors such as quality, price, delivery time, and reliability.</li>
              <li>Negotiating Contracts: After selecting suppliers, the organization needs to negotiate contracts with them. This involves determining the terms of the agreement, such as pricing, payment terms, delivery schedules, and quality requirements.</li>
              <li>Managing Inventory: Purchasing management also involves managing inventory levels to ensure that the organization has the necessary goods or services on hand to meet its operational needs. This involves monitoring inventory levels, ordering goods or services as needed, and managing the flow of goods into and out of the organization.</li>
              <li>Evaluating Supplier Performance: Effective purchasing management involves evaluating supplier performance on an ongoing basis. This helps to ensure that suppliers are meeting their obligations under the contract and that the organization is receiving the best value for its money.</li>

          <p class="text-justify">There are problems that may encounter on older purchasing management systems including:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Manual Processes: Older purchasing management systems often rely on manual processes, such as paper forms, spreadsheets, and manual data entry. This can result in errors, delays, and increased labor costs.</li>
              <li>Limited Data Visibility: Older purchasing management systems may not provide real-time access to procurement data, making it difficult to track and manage procurement information effectively.</li>
              <li>Inefficient Resource Allocation: Older purchasing management systems may not effectively allocate resources, such as personnel and equipment, resulting in underutilization or overutilization.</li>
              <li>Limited Functionality: Older purchasing management systems may lack modern functionality, such as self-service portals, mobile access, and analytics capabilities, which can limit their usefulness and reduce their ability to support modern procurement practices.</li>
              <li>Compliance Risks: Older purchasing management systems may not be compliant with current regulations, increasing the risk of legal and financial penalties.</li>
              <li>Limited Supplier Management Capabilities: Older purchasing management systems may lack the capability to effectively manage supplier performance and relationships, which can impact the quality, cost, and delivery of goods and services.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">ASV Business Solution’s procurement process can be automated and streamlined with the help of the Cirquolus Purchasing Management System (CPMS) software. A CPMS's main goal is to increase the effectiveness, precision, and 
            speed of purchasing operations while lowering the expense and risk involved in procurement.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">Vendor management, requisition management, purchase order management, invoice processing, and supplier performance management are all common components of a CPMS. Advanced features that include electronic signature capabilities, 
            automated invoice matching, and spend analysis tools are available in some PMS packages.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">Companies can boost the effectiveness of the procurement procedure, save expenses, and gain authority over their purchasing activities by installing a PMS. This can assist firms in improving their purchasing efficiency and bottom line.</p>
